  <p class="BasicParEdit">Welcome to the end of the course. Understandably you can't yet go to Germany and talk like the best of them. This site was never intended for that. This was a short lesson plan to familiarize you with the very basics of the language. There are just some things that a guy with a semester's worth of programming knowledge and limited time can't put into lesson plans. But if you went through this and thought, "Hey, German seems like a cool language to learn. Maybe I should give it a shot", go for it! Chico State is lucky to have a major pathway for German. If classes aren't your style, check out the link below to Duolingo for a more casual learning experience. Until then, <span class="HiLite">Tsch√ºss!</span>(Bye!).</p> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
