    <p class="BasicParEdit">There are several ways to greet others in German. The easiest ways are a simple <span class="HiLite">Hi</span> or <span class="HiLite">Hallo</span>. If you want to say "Good morning" or something equivalent then use one of these phrases:</p>
    <ul id="BasicFontSize">
      <li>In the Morning: (Guten) Morgen!</li>
      <li>In the Afternoon: (Guten) Tag!</li>
      <li>In the evening: (Guten) Abend!</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="BasicParEdit">Now that you can properly say hello to people, let's look at how you can ask for another person's name. To ask someone what their name is, you say: <span class="HiLite">Wie heißt du?</span>. The ß character is pronounced as if it's two S's. To respond to this question you would say: <span class="HiLite">Ich heiße [Your Name]</span>.</p>
    <p class="Note">Note: "Wie heißt du" is informal and only used with peers and friends. To formally ask you would instead say "Wie heißen Sie". Don't worry about formal for these lessons however.</p>
    <p class="BasicParEdit">Lastly for this lesson, you should know how to respond after meeting someone new. The appropriate response is <span class="HiLite">Es freut mich</span>. This translates to "Pleased to meet you"</p>
    <h1 class="Ex">Practice</h1>
    <p class="Ex">1. How would you ask someone their name?</p>
    <input class="Ex" id="Q1" oninput="check1()" type="text">
    <button class="Ex" onclick="ssFunctionQ1()">ß</button>
    <span class="hidden-message" id="Val">Placeholder</span>
    <p class="ExSp1">2. How would you respond if someone asked for your name?(Leave out your name)</p>
    <input class="ExSp1" id="Q2" oninput="check2()" type="text">
     <button class="ExSp1" onclick="ssFunctionQ2()">ß</button>
         <span class="hidden-message" id="Val2">Placeholder</span>
    <p class="ExSp1">3. What would be a good response to just meeting someone?</p>
    <input class="Ex" id="Q3" oninput="check3()" type="text">
    <button class="Ex" onclick="ssFunctionQ3()">ß</button>
    <span class="hidden-message" id="Val3">Placeholder</span>
